- Visibility of System Status
    
    - The navigation menu (hamburger menu) icon is hidden by default but becomes visible on smaller screens, indicating its functionality when the menu is hidden. 

- Match Between System and the Real World
    
    - Use of common icons like the cart and user account icons to easily identify what each icon refers to.

- User Control and Freedom
    
    - The hamburger menu allows users to control navigation by revealing or hiding the menu on smaller screens like mobile and tablet.

- Consistency and Standards
    
    - The design and layout of navigation elements appear consistent and aligned with standard practices.

- Error Prevention
    
    - Since the code lacks a verification of the data for login system and user input forms which can be achieved only using JavaScript, there are no opportunities for error prevention mechanisms.

- Recognition Rather than Recall
    
    - Labels for navigation links (e.g., "Home," "Products," "List Item") make it easy for users to recognize and understand their purpose without requiring recall.

- Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
    
    - The design appears straightforward and suitable for various screen sizes.

- Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
    
    - The design is clean and minimalist and not overly cluttered, promoting a pleasant user experience.

- Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
    
    - Error messages and recovery steps are not applicable to this code as it lacks a verification and validation for login system or user input forms which can be achieved through JavaScript or other language.

- Help and Documentation
    
    - This is simple HTML5 and CSS3 website so there is no explicit help or documentation section in the code, this may not be necessary.
